    "title": "1 UNDERSTANDING THE H&S CULTURE ASSESSMENT",
    "htmlContent": `<p>
    The Health & Safety (H&S) Culture within an
    organisation is a major influence on the H&S
    behaviours of people at work. Ultimately the
    culture will determine how safe the work
    environment is and is quite literally a matter
    of life and death. <br />
    Developing a H&S Culture requires the
    organisation to first identify the existing
    culture, the reality of where they are now.
    Once this is done, a strategic roadmap may be
    developed to move from what the current
    culture stands at, to the desired culture.
    <br />
    The aim of this report is to outline the
    existing maturity which may be used as a base
    to develop an action plan for leaders and the
    workforce to implement, which will further
    develop the maturity of the organization’s
    safety culture; not just supporting the
    company’s safety goals, but also eliminating
    the risk of harm – covering both physical and
    mental well-being. <br />
    To determine the level of the H&S culture
    maturity within
    *CLIENT NAME*,
    WSP has explored one of three interrelated
    aspects of culture, explained further on.
    <br />
    One of the most definitive and well-respected
    definitions of a Safety Culture was developed
    by UK’s Health & Safety Executive’s Advisory
    Committee on the Safety of Nuclear
    Installations (ACSNI: HSC, 1993). This along
    with a framework (Cooper, 2000) commonly used
    to distinguish between three interrelated, but
    not mutually exclusive, aspects of a Safety
    Culture.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Three Interrelated Aspects of a Safety
    Culture, as presented in Figure 11 are:<br />
    — Psychological aspect: this aspect is
    understood by conducting a survey which
    provides detailed insight into group and
    individual values, attitudes, and perceptions
    in relation to H&S.
    <br />
    — Behavioural aspects are explored through
    direct observations and conversations.
    <br />
    Organisational aspects: WSP Consultants would
    review relevant H&S documentation and conduct
    interviews collective insights to questions
    centered around Personal Ownership and
    Performance Psychology, Working Environment
    And Technology Interface, Management
    Perception And Business Focus, Exemplary
    Leadership And Wellbeing.

    <b>Accidents and Incidents<br /></b>
    The outcome of an immature HSE culture is poor
    safety performance. Fatalities and serious
    injuries<br />
    will continue to happen
    within “ORGANIZATION”
    unless actions to improve the HSE culture
    maturity are immediately initiated.

    <b>How to use this HSE Culture Assessment Report</b>
    <br/>
    The assessment results and recommendations
    provided in this report are intended to
    stimulate
    <br />
    discussion and ideas within “ORGANIZATION”
    to further mature the health, safety, and
    environmental culture.
    <br />
    Creating open discussions throughout the
    organisation will involve and even empower
    people to action. Together with your
    employees, seek to produce an action plan that
    will lead a continually improving HSE culture
    within “ORGANIZATION”.

              Figure 12 Safety Culture Maturity Model
            </h5>
            <h6><b>Level One: Emerging</b></h6>
            <p>
              Safety is defined in terms of technical and
              procedural solutions and compliance with
              regulations. Safety is not seen as a key
              business risk and the safety department is
              perceived to have primary responsibility for
              safety. Many accidents are seen as unavoidable
              and as part of the job. Most frontline staff
              are uninterested in safety and may only use
              safety as the basis for other arguments, such
              as changes in shift systems.
            </p>
            <h6><b>Level Two: Managing</b></h6>
            <p>
              Safety is seen as a business risk and
              management time and effort is put into
              accident prevention. Safety is solely defined
              in terms of adherence to rules and procedures
              and engineering controls. Accidents are seen
              as preventable. Managers perceive that the
              majority of accidents are solely caused by the
              unsafe behaviour of front-line staff. Safety
              performance is measured in terms of lagging
              indicators such as Lost Time Injuries (LTIs)
              and safety incentives are based on reduced LTI
              rates. Senior managers are reactive in their
              involvement in H&S (i.e., they use punishment
              when accident rates increase).
            </p>
            <h6><b>Level Three: Involving</b></h6>
            <p>
              The organisation is convinced that the
              involvement of frontline employees in H&S is
              critical if future improvements are going to
              be achieved. Managers recognise that a wide
              range of factors cause accidents, and the root
              causes often originate from management
              decisions. A significant proportion of
              frontline employees are willing to work with
              management to improve H&S. The majority of
              staff accept personal responsibility for their
              own H&S. Safety performance is actively
              monitored, and the data is used effectively.
            </p>
            <h6><b>Level Four: Empowering</b></h6>
            <p>
              Most staff in the organisation are convinced
              that H&S is important from both a moral and
              economic point of view. Frontline staff accept
              personal responsibility for their own H&S and
              that of others. Managers and frontline staff
              recognise that a wide range of factors cause
              accidents, and the root causes are likely to
              come back to management decisions. Frontline
              staff accept personal responsibility for their
              own and others’ H&S. The importance of all
              employees feeling valued and treated fairly is
              recognised. The organisation puts significant
              effort into proactive measures to prevent
              accidents. Safety performance is actively
              monitored using all data available. Non-work
              accidents are also monitored, and a healthy
              lifestyle is promoted.
            </p>
            <p>
              The prevention of all injuries or harm to
              employees (both at work and at home) is a core
              company value. The organisation has had a
              sustained period (years) without a recordable
              accident or high potential incident, but there
              is no feeling of complacency. They live with
              an increased awareness that their next
              accident is just around the corner. The
              organisation uses a range of indicators to
              monitor performance, but it is not
              performance-driven, as it has confidence in
              its safety processes. The organisation is
              constantly striving to be better and find
              better ways of improving hazard control
              mechanisms. All employees share the belief
              that H&S is a critical aspect of their job and
              accept that the prevention of non-work
              injuries is important. The company invests
              considerable effort in promoting H&S at home.

    The average rating from the survey results
    were
    * CLIENT *
    which would normally suggest a *mature / immature*
    culture, however the analysis of the survey
    results identified a high number of
    statistically significant differences between
    the groups: <br />—
    *CATEGORY*
    -Statistically significant difference between
    *X OUT OF TOTAL NUMBER*
    statements.
    <br />—
    *CATEGORY* -
    Statistically significant difference between
    *X OUT OF TOTAL NUMBER*
    statements.
    <br />
      This indicates that there is a fundamental
      lack of consistency between groups which
      strongly suggests a less mature safety
      culture.
    -(IF STATISTACAL DIFFERENCE IS HIGH)
    <br />
    The sections that scored lowest in the survey
    that need to be to be prioritised based on
    risk exposure from each of these sections are:
    <br />- Personal Ownership and Performance
    Psychology (MEAN OF X)
    <br />- Working Environment And Technology
    Interface (MEAN OF X)
    <br />- Management Perception And Business
    Focus (MEAN OF X)
    <br />- Exemplary Leadership And Wellbeing (MEAN OF X)
    <br />
      Evidence from the survey indicates that
      safety is still limited to technical and
      procedural solutions based on compliance.
      Safety is currently not fully appreciated as
      a business risk which is evident in the
      manpower and excessive overtime issues.
      Evidence from the site visits highlighted
      that *COMPANY NAME* is making significant

    <p>
              A culture survey which was developed by
              Loughbourgh University
              based on the UK Health & Safety Executive
              culture survey along with some additional
              Client specified Organisation Specific
              questions was issued to *COMPANY NAME*
              electronically. *COMPANY NAME* distributed the
              survey to their Staff and Directly Supervised
              Contractors (DSCs), of which
              *TOTAL*
              responses in total were
                received.
                <br />
                The survey was based on a factor structure
                that looks at 5 main sections:
                <br />
                — Personal Ownership and Performance
                Psychology contains 11 questions
                <br />
                — Working Environment And Technology
                Interface contains 5 questions
                <br />
                — Management Perception And Business Focus
                contains 16 questions
                <br />
                — Exemplary Leadership And Wellbeing
                contains 10 questions
                <br />
                — Organisation Specific Questions contains x
                questions
                <br />
              The Survey consisted of
                *TOTAL QUESTION NUMBER*
              questions and statements.
              Of the TOTAL QUESTION NUMBER*,
                Of the TOTAL QUESTION NUMBER*
              of the questions identified demographics and X
              was provided for general feedback. Individuals
              had to score the remaining
              Of the TOTAL QUESTION NUMBER*
              statements on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being
              ‘Strongly Disagree’ and 10 being ‘Strongly
              Agree’.

            <br />
            <p class="firstText">
              Several statements were stated in reverse
              order or a negative manner to gain a more
              accurate understanding of people’s belief. For
              the purposes of the analyses and reporting,
              all the results for the negatively phrased
              statements have been inverted. Therefore, a
              higher score should be a “positive” indication
              making it visually easy to identify concerns
              with specific areas.
              <br />
              The results of the survey were analysed using
              a statistical analysis software (SPSS) to
              determine the level of coherence by
              identifying any statistically significant
              difference (whether one group&#39;s answers
              are significantly different from another
              group&#39;s answers) within the various
              Factors and Sections.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The statistical analysis software also
              calculates the various Means:
              <br />— Grand Mean – This is the overall
              average score for the entire survey
              (RESULT);;<br />—
              Factor Mean – This is the average score for a
              specific factor e.g.,
              ‘QUESTION GROUP;
              <br />— Section Mean – This is the average
              score for each Section forming part of a
              specific factor e.g.,
               ‘QUESTION GROUP.
              <br />
              This is then used to identify individuals’
              belief in relation to the various Factors and
              Sections. The range of factors in the survey
              are diverse, covering the:

              This, at first sight, may appear to be a
              positive result however, across the survey
              there are significant statistically
              significant differences between how the
              different categories perceive the culture
              within the organisation.
              <br />
              Analysis was conducted to compare the results
              between groups of respondents. The survey
              collected information about the respondents’
              *DEMOGRAPHIC*
              within the organisation. The data was also
              classified according to the
              *DEMOGRAPHIC*
              . The statistical test used is a Multivariate
              Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) that examines
              the differences in scores for each statement
              while controlling the probability that some
              differences will occur by chance. The test
              works on the assumption that differences
              between groups are seen by chance and
              calculates the probability that the difference
              observed is not due to chance. A statistically
              significant difference is defined as being an
              equal to or greater than 95% probability that
              the difference in scores for a particular
              statement between the groups is a “real”
              difference. Of the
