      '<p>\n    The Health & Safety (H&S) Culture within an\n    organisation is a major influence on the H&S\n    behaviours of people at work. Ultimately the\n    culture will determine how safe the work\n    environment is and is quite literally a matter\n    of life and death. <br />\n    Developing a H&S Culture requires the\n    organisation to first identify the existing\n    culture, the reality of where they are now.\n    Once this is done, a strategic roadmap may be\n    developed to move from what the current\n    culture stands at, to the desired culture.\n    <br />\n    The aim of this report is to outline the\n    existing maturity which may be used as a base\n    to develop an action plan for leaders and the\n    workforce to implement, which will further\n    develop the maturity of the organization’s\n    safety culture; not just supporting the\n    company’s safety goals, but also eliminating\n    the risk of harm – covering both physical and\n    mental well-being. <br />\n    To determine the level of the H&S culture\n    maturity within\n    *CLIENT NAME*,\n    WSP has explored one of three interrelated\n    aspects of culture, explained further on.\n    <br />\n    One of the most definitive and well-respected\n    definitions of a Safety Culture was developed\n    by UK’s Health & Safety Executive’s Advisory\n    Committee on the Safety of Nuclear\n    Installations (ACSNI: HSC, 1993). This along\n    with a framework (Cooper, 2000) commonly used\n    to distinguish between three interrelated, but\n    not mutually exclusive, aspects of a Safety\n    Culture.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Three Interrelated Aspects of a Safety\n    Culture, as presented in Figure 11 are:<br />\n    — Psychological aspect: this aspect is\n    understood by conducting a survey which\n    provides detailed insight into group and\n    individual values, attitudes, and perceptions\n    in relation to H&S.\n    <br />\n    — Behavioural aspects are explored through\n    direct observations and conversations.\n    <br />\n    Organisational aspects: WSP Consultants would\n    review relevant H&S documentation and conduct\n    interviews collective insights to questions\n    centered around Personal Ownership and\n    Performance Psychology, Working Environment\n    And Technology Interface, Management\n    Perception And Business Focus, Exemplary\n    Leadership And Wellbeing.\n  </p>\n\n  <p><img alt="" src="http://52.23.223.200:8000/storage/v1/object/public/wsp/report/img2.png" style="height:332px; width:714px" /></p>\n\n  ',

Safety is not seen as a key\n              business risk and the safety department is\n              perceived to have primary responsibility for\n              safety. Many accidents are seen as unavoidable\n              and as part of the job. Most frontline staff\n              are uninterested in safety and may only use\n              safety as the basis for other arguments, such\n              as changes in shift systems.\n            </p>\n            <h6><b>Level Two: Managing</b></h6>\n            <p>\n              Safety is seen as a business risk and\n              management time and effort is put into\n              accident prevention. Safety is solely defined\n              in terms of adherence to rules and procedures\n              and engineering controls. Accidents are seen\n              as preventable. Managers perceive that the\n              majority of accidents are solely caused by the\n              unsafe behaviour of front-line staff. Safety\n              performance is measured in terms of lagging\n              indicators such as Lost Time Injuries (LTIs)\n              and safety incentives are based on reduced LTI\n              rates. Senior managers are reactive in their\n              involvement in H&S (i.e., they use punishment\n              when accident rates increase).\n            </p>\n            <h6><b>Level Three: Involving</b></h6>\n            <p>\n              The organisation is convinced that the\n              involvement of frontline employees in H&S is\n              critical if future improvements are going to\n              be achieved. Managers recognise that a wide\n              range of factors cause accidents, and the root\n              causes often originate from management\n              decisions. A significant proportion of\n              frontline employees are willing to work with\n              management to improve H&S. The majority of\n              staff accept personal responsibility for their\n              own H&S. Safety performance is actively\n              monitored, and the data is used effectively.\n            </p>\n            <h6><b>Level Four: Empowering</b></h6>\n            <p>\n              Most staff in the organisation are convinced\n              that H&S is important from both a moral and\n              economic point of view. Frontline staff accept\n              personal responsibility for their own H&S and\n              that of others. Managers and frontline staff\n              recognise that a wide range of factors cause\n              accidents, and the root causes are likely to\n              come back to management decisions. Frontline\n              staff accept personal responsibility for their\n              own and others’ H&S. The importance of all\n              employees feeling valued and treated fairly is\n              recognised. The organisation puts significant\n              effort into proactive measures to prevent\n              accidents. Safety performance is actively\n              monitored using all data available. Non-work\n              accidents are also monitored, and a healthy\n              lifestyle is promoted.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The prevention of all injuries or harm to\n              employees (both at work and at home) is a core\n              company value. The organisation has had a\n              sustained period (years) without a recordable\n              accident or high potential incident, but there\n              is no feeling of complacency. They live with\n              an increased awareness that their next\n              accident is just around the corner. The\n              organisation uses a range of indicators to\n              monitor performance, but it is not\n              performance-driven, as it has confidence in\n              its safety processes. The organisation is\n              constantly striving to be better and find\n              better ways of improving hazard control\n              mechanisms. All employees share the belief\n              that H&S is a critical aspect of their job and\n              accept that the prevention of non-work\n              injuries is important. The company invests\n              considerable effort in promoting H&S at home.\n            </p>\n    ',

The statistical test used is a Multivariate\n              Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) that examines\n              the differences in scores for each statement\n              while controlling the probability that some\n              differences will occur by chance. The test\n              works on the assumption that differences\n              between groups are seen by chance and\n              calculates the probability that the difference\n              observed is not due to chance. A statistically\n              significant difference is defined as being an\n              equal to or greater than 95% probability that\n              the difference in scores for a particular\n              statement between the groups is a “real”\n              difference. Of the\n              *TOTAL*\n              statements,\n              *X* showed this\n              difference between the different\n              *DEMOGRAPHIC*\n              and\n              *X* showed this\n              difference between the different\n              *DEMOGRAPHIC*\n              , which is considered as extremely high and\n              draws us towards the conclusion that\n              organisational safety climate is far from\n              uniform.\n              <br />\n              The descriptive statistics for the groups are\n              included in the appendix. The implications of\n              these statistically significant results will\n              be discussed in the relevant sections below.\n            </p>\n    ',
